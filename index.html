<h1>Welcome to my website, neilhq.tech</h1>

    Passwords: make yours strong and secure.
</div>
<div class="text-Two">
    What is the minimum number of characters required for a strong password? What complexity is required for a strong password?<br>
    To answer those two questions, both number of characters and complexity must be met for a strong password.<br>
    So what are the minimum requirements? A password should contain at least twelve characters and contain numbers, lowercase <br>
    and uppercase letters. With those requirements met, in the year 2024, it would take a hacker 38 million years to brute force<br>
    your password. Surprisingly, in the year 2022, it would have taken a hacker 200 years to brute force your password.<br>
    <br>
    So why has it become more difficult to brute force passwords of the same length and complexity in the year 2024 than in the year 2022?<br>
    It is because the hashing algorithms being used to store passwords have become stronger. To put it another way, the companies (websites)<br>
    which store your passwords should be using the latest and strongest hashing algorithms in order to keep your password secure.<br>
    <br>
    Since we rely on someone else to keep our passwords secure, it is the author's opinion that you should future proof your passwords by having<br>
    a minimum of sixteen characters including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters.<br> 
    <br>
    So how do I generate a secure random password? You could use an online service like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/" style="color:#DE7900;">bitwarden.com/password-generator/</a> <br>
    but even better, the author has created a password generator for the Windows and Linux operating systems.<br>
    You can download my password generator, which is located on my github website here: <a href="https://github.com/portopen/password-generator/releases" style="color:#DE7900;">Password-Generator</a> <br>
     You will find the Windows executable and Linux binary under the heading "Assets".<br>
    <br>
    Where did I get the statistics for the strength of passwords? <br>
    All information on this topic was from the research completed by <a href="https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green" style="color:#DE7900;">hivesystems.com</a><br>
